I study censorship and network security, and my work seeks to enable open
communication and support missions in cyberspace. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer
Science at the University of Maryland, advised by [Dave
Levin](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dml/). 

I created [Geneva](https://geneva.cs.umd.edu), a genetic algorithm that
discovers ways to evade nation-state Internet censorship, and advise the censorship
team in the [Breakerspace Lab](https://breakerspace.io). I am honored to be 
a winner of Facebook and USNEIX's [Internet Defense
Prize](https://www.usenix.org/blog/facebook-and-usenix-announce-winners-2021-internet-defense-prize),
IRTF's international [Applied Network Research Prize](https://irtf.org/anrp/)
(ANRP), and a recipient of USENIX Security's [Distinguished Paper
Award](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/bock).

Outside of my censorship work, I am currently working with Amazon Web Services
and with the University of Maryland as an adjunct faculty member. I
am the creator of _HACS408T: Introduction to Penetration Testing_
for the University of Maryland Honors College Program
[ACES](https://aces.umd.edu/) (Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students), which 
I teach every Spring semester.
